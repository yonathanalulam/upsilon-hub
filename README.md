An automated intelligence platform tracking the frontier of modern physics.

⚡
The Mission:
Keeping up with scientific breakthroughs is difficult. The signal-to-noise ratio in modern media is low, and important discoveries often get buried under clickbait.

[Upsilon Hub](https://upsilon-hub.vercel.app/) solves this by aggregating raw, high-impact research news from the world's most respected institutions like CERN, NASA, MIT, and leading physics journals,into one clean, real-time feed.

🤖
How It Works:
Automated Retrieval:A custom scraping engine runs daily at 6:00 AM UTC via GitHub Actions.
Smart Filtering:Algorithms filter out irrelevant noise and categorize content into Quantum, Astrophysics, and High Energy Physics.
Self-Deploying:The system automatically rebuilds and deploys the live site on Vercel whenever new data is verified.
